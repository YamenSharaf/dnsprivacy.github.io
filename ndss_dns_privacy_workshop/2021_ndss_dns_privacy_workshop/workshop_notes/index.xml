      <description>Zoom Breakout Room 1: Measurement of Encrypted DNS Kick-off question from Sandra: Who are we designing encrypted DNS protocols for? Idea from Benno (who couldn&amp;rsquo;t be present in the session): these protocols need to be designed to work for everybody. Alec: I don&amp;rsquo;t think &amp;ldquo;designing for everybody&amp;rdquo; would go well. DNS is a distributed protocol; it is a distributed database. It is very presumpuous of us to designate threat models onto third parties.</description>

      <description>Zoom Breakout Room 3: Novel Work, ADoT and Future Research Benno&amp;rsquo;s summary&#xA;Liang&amp;rsquo;s talk - IP address encryption as a complement to DOH or DOT, no change to DNS, no changes on endpoints. Can we get privacy benefit from this&#xA;Scott&amp;rsquo;s talk and DKG&amp;rsquo;s talk - there&amp;rsquo;s information leaked above recursive, but Scott asks if it&amp;rsquo;s operationally feasible for the auth operator to do encryption, whereas DKG takes the view that it needs to be</description>
